# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
users = User.create(email: 'email@admin.com', password: 'sEcReT', role: 1)
    users.save
